What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a .git directory which at this time is an empty repository
	with no commits. It has to be done to create the repository.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is and area where the files that are ready to be commited are. Working Directorry holds all files indepnedently of
	the intention to commit them. Repository holds all versions of commited files.
	The value added of staging area is the separation of files between the ones to be commited from the rest.
