How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It help me by showing me the difference between the two file versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Usually programmers make changes that regret doing them, because program crashes for example.
By going back to old versions running versions could be restored.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Git commits are more meaningful that automatic saves.  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because git uses a repository of files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log brings all commits so we can see the commits that were made whereas git diff 
	shows the differences between two of them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
	It always make me go back to previous version. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to use it for programming in android studio
